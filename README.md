Due to anonymization, this repository provides only a snapshot of the core code base, which is not  production ready without considerable effort.

## Structure
Folder '''Plugins''' contains the Java projects of Guido. Necessary libraries are not included due to licensing.

Folder '''Tools''' contains a few scripts for running the client-server architecture

File '''Experimentsdata.zip''' contains verification subjects, the configuration space models, and experiments of the hypothesis testing.
